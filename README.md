# MTGWLSTATS
A simple parsing tool that takes input from https://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/History and calculates overall win/loss % and reports by overall, by opponent name, and by format

To use this tool:
1.  Login to your wizards.com account and navigate to https://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/History.
2.  Click the "expand all" red arrow on the upper lefthand side.
3.  Scroll down the page to insure all records are expanded
4.  Ctrl-A on the page to select all text.
5.  Paste the text into a .txt file and move the file to the same directory as this project files.
6.  Run the program (needs C++ compiler and capabilities) and enter the appropriate textfile name when prompted.

Future work: I hope to incorporate this into a simple website where you can just paste your record.
